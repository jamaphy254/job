        <p>We deal with vegetables and various fruits.</p>
        <p>When it comes to eating more produce, you can't go wrong. Long story short: Every single fruit (and vegetable!) is a great option. Research has shown eating a minimum of four to five servings per day helps to boost mood and reduce your risk of heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 10% of Americans eat enough fruit — about 1½ to 2 cups daily. Many of us also miss out on sufficient dietary fiber, calcium, potassium and magnesium, all of which are found in abundance in produce. Potassium, for example, helps maintain a healthy blood pressure and you'll get it easily in bananas, prunes and cantaloupe. The fiber in fruit also supports better digestion and fills you up for fewer calories, making it a smart choice for your health overall and can help if you're trying to lose weight.<br>

        <p>Whether you choose fresh or frozen, make it your goal to get more fruit into every meal. Sprinkle mixed berries into morning oatmeal or onto toast with nut butter, carry a banana or a bunch of grapes for a mid-afternoon snack, or toss avocado into a heart-healthy salad at dinner. No matter how you slice it, eating more fruit can benefit your body and your mind — starting with these ideas.</p>
